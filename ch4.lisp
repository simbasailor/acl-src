;; 4.3 Strings and Characters
;; Strings are vectors of characters. We denote a constant string as
;; a series of characters surrounded by double-quotes, and a individual
;; character c as #\c.
;; Each character has an associated integer -- usually, but not necessarily,
;; the ASCII number. In most implementations, the function char-code returns
;; the number associated with a character, and code-char returns the character
;; associated with a number.
;; The function char< (less than), char<= (less than or equal),
;; char= (equal), char>= (greater than or equal) char> (greater then),
;; and char/= (different) compare characters.
(sort "elbow" #'char<)
(aref "abc" 1)
;; but with a string you can use the faster char:
(char "abc" 1)
;; You can use setf with char (or aref) to replace elements:
(let ((str (copy-seq "Merlin")))
  (setf (char str 3) #\k)
  str)

;; If you want to compare two strings, you can use the general equal,
;; but there is also a function string-equal that ignores case:
(equal "fred" "fred")
(equal "fred" "Fred")
(string-equal "fred" "Fred")
;; Common lisp provides a large number of functions for comparing and
;; manipulating strings.
;; There are several ways of building strings.
;; The most general is to use format. Calling format with nil as the first
;; argument makes it return as a string what it would have printed:
(format nil "~A or ~A" "truth" "dare")
;; But if you just want to join several strings together, you can use
;; concatenat, which takes a symbol indicting the type of the result,
;; plus on or more sequences:
(concatenate 'string "not " "to worry")
